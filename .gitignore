# If you manually download libraries into 'external/' and don't want to commit them,
# uncomment the relevant lines. If using submodules, this is not needed for the submodule itself.
# external/imgui/ # If not a submodule and you only want to track your integration code
# external/glm/   # If not a submodule
# external/sdl2/  # If not a submodule or system library

# User-specific configuration (e.g., local ImGui settings if not portable)
imgui.ini # Often user-specific layout, better to ignore and let it regenerate

# Large binary files (if any) that are not essential assets or are generated
# For example, if you had very large video test files or huge datasets.
# Your primary assets (textures, models, sounds in assets/) ARE typically versioned.
